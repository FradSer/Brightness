# Brightness
Sync macbook screen brightness to non-Apple external display.

It has no UI whatsoever, infrequently crashes, and does not work very well when paired with a external Apple monitor. It occasionally fails to sync the brightness for a moment. But it's the best I was able to do.

Please send pull requests. This app could be so beautiful.
